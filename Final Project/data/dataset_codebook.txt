This is a codebook for all of the variables in the 'Math Students' dataset. I have used the codebook that was associated with the original Kaggle dataset as a reference, but rewritten all of the explanations for the variables to be more clear. The variable types and what they are labelled as in the dataset are also present, since those are relevant for our purposes.
